#Create a function that takes a string as an argument and adds the phrase "Only in America!" to the end of it

#Create a function to find the maximum value in an array of numbers. For instance: [100,10,-1000] should return 100. Do not use Ruby's built-in .max function.

#Create a function that takes two arguments - both of them arrays. Inside of the function, 
#combine the arrays using the items from the first array as keys and the second array as values. For example, when these two arrays are supplied as arguments:


#Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, except:
#for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
#for multiples of five print "Buzz"
#Print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5.
